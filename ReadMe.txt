Code:

(1) Real Data Analysis
Open the "example" file and run "main_lasercase.m" in MATLAB to obtain the Figures 10-12 and Tables 1-3 in the case study.

(2) Simulation
First, run "main_simulation.m" in MATLAB to obtain the simulation results for the coverage probabilities, average interval lengths of the parameters, reliability function, and RUL prediction intervals.
Then, organize the output results into "Data_summary.xlsx".
Next, use the R script "figure_simulation.r" to generate Figures 1-9 in the simulation study.
